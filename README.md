## 📌 Project Overview

This website was developed in **Wix Studio** and is fully integrated with **GitHub**, featuring:

### ✅ Features Implemented

- **Custom Signup Form**  
  Users can register using a custom signup form. Data is saved to `Members/PrivateMembersData`.

- **Metaverse + Thank You Page**  
  After successful signup, users are redirected to the `Metaverse` page, which also serves as a thank-you screen.

- **Access Restriction Logic**  
  - Users not logged in or not in the Members database see “Access Denied”.
  - Approved members are automatically granted access to the Gather.town Metaverse space.

- **Gather.town Integration**  
  Direct access to the Gather.town space upon signup.

- **FAQ Section**  
  Search and dropdown-based filtering available.

- **Contact Us Page**  
  Includes alt text and proper HTML tags

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Wix Studio
- **Backend**: Velo (Wix Code)
- **Database**: Wix CMS Collections
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User signs up through the custom form.
2. They are added to the Members CMS (`PrivateMembersData`).
3. After signup, they are redirected to the Metaverse page.
4. Access is checked — unauthorized users see “Access Denied”.

## 📝 Notes

- Apologies for any early issues — all features now work properly.
- GitHub contains all final backend code, including:
  - Signup logic
  - Guestlist/member verification
  - FAQ search & dropdown behavior code in github
